Changelog/Mental Notes

 -------------------------------------------May 8th-------------------------------------------
  A C++ bug that I have been introduced to:
  * I have a Tape pointer which is located on the stack, pointing to an area on the heap.
    This pointer belongs to the TuringMachine Object and when the destructor gets called
    it runs "delete tape;" This should just take the pointer and delete everything that
    it references, however when it does this it gives me a double free runtime error.
    When I delete the destructor function it runs just fine however I am worried that
    there is a memory leak somewhere.

    I have taken some notes:
      * Corruption is when something is deleted before all references to it go out of scope.
      * Memory leak is where there are no more memory references to an item, however there is still
        memory allocated for it.

    Here are some steps I have taken to research my runtime error:
      * I installed a program called valgrind which checks for memory leaks, and when I ran it
        with my program, it said that there were no possible memory leaks both with and without
        the destructor functions. It works perfectly without the destructor functions (no
        corruptions or memory leaks) so I think I am just going to leave them out for now.
	I think that with the destructor functions there is some weird corruption happening
        which I would really like to find. I am not sure why it is occurring.

  Some mental notes!
  * Instead of going out of my way to avoid letting people change the state of certain objects,
    why do I not just make them const?

  * Can I write a program that generates tests for the Virtual Turing Machine?
    - Theorum for proving ALL functions/algorithms will work?

  * How did I fix multiplication and division?
    - How is multiplication and division used? Is it correct?

  * What can I do to make my code even cleaner?
    - Parser changes!

  * Where would I like to take this program in the future?
    - Possible website to show hiring managers. Rewrite in JavaScript?
    - What else can I challenge myself to learn in C++?

  Memory Issues Continued...
  * So I have overwritten the copy constructor and the assignment operator
    for the TuringMachine.cpp class in hopes that I will stop getting the double 
    free or corruption error! At first I was getting a bad allocation error 
    with my assignment operator, and I made some changes. I think that this error
    is due to the runtime making sure that all the information was actually copied.
    I was not copying (or allocating) every member of the class and when I changed
    my code to do so it started working. However, I am still getting a double free or
    corruption error. I am not sure why and it is very annoying. What I am going to do
    is make a project on github, then do some heavy refactoring to the code. That way I
    can just go back on what I did if I made a serious mistake.
